# Image-Recognition-System

Image Recognition System — Overview
An image classification web application that identifies objects in uploaded images. Users upload photos through a web interface; the backend runs a trained CNN (TensorFlow/Keras) to predict object labels and returns predictions in real time. The app can be extended to multi-label classification, bounding-box detection, or live video inference.

Objective
Build a robust image classifier to recognize objects in images.

Provide a simple web UI for users to upload images and get predictions.

Log predictions and usage for analytics and model improvement.

Ship a deployable MVP (Dockerized Flask app) and provide training scripts for model improvement.

Core Features
Image upload & preview UI.

Real-time prediction endpoint (REST API).

Preprocessing pipeline (resize, normalize, augment for training).

Model training & evaluation (train/val/test split, metrics).

Confidence scores & top-k predictions.

Logging of uploads, predictions, timestamps, and user metadata.

Optional: class visualization (Grad-CAM) and model explainability.

Tools & Technologies
Language: Python

Web Framework: Flask (or FastAPI for async/high-performance)

ML Framework: TensorFlow / Keras (or PyTorch if preferred)

Image Processing: OpenCV, Pillow

Data Handling: NumPy, pandas, tf.data API

Model Ops / Storage: SavedModel format, optionally TF-Hub, or ONNX for portability

Database / Logging: SQLite for MVP (upgradeable to Postgres)

Deployment: Docker, Gunicorn/uvicorn, optionally Kubernetes or Cloud Run

Monitoring / Visualization: TensorBoard, Prometheus/Grafana (advanced)

Optional Services: Label-studio for annotation, Weights & Biases for experiment tracking

Architecture (High level)
Frontend (HTML/JS): Image upload form, shows prediction results & top-k probabilities.

Backend (Flask):

/predict endpoint accepts multipart image uploads, runs preprocessing, loads model, returns JSON predictions.

/health, /metrics, admin endpoints for model reload.

Model: Keras CNN (Transfer learning with MobileNetV2 / EfficientNet / ResNet50) exported as SavedModel.

Storage: SQLite for logs; local file store or cloud bucket for uploaded images.

DevOps: Docker container with model files, environment variables, and gunicorn/uvicorn.

Implementation Plan & Timeline (MVP)
Day 0–1: Data & Scope

Choose dataset (ImageNet subset, CIFAR-10/100 for proof, or custom dataset).

Define classes, data format, and acceptance metrics (accuracy, F1).

Day 2–4: Training Prototype

Use transfer learning (MobileNetV2 or EfficientNet-lite).

Build tf.data pipeline with augmentations (flip, rotate, color jitter).

Train model, save best checkpoint, evaluate test set.

Day 5–6: Backend API & Inference

Create Flask app with /predict and /health.

Load model once at startup; implement image preprocessing consistent with training.

Day 7: Frontend & Logging

Minimal HTML/JS upload page.

Save logs to SQLite with image path, predicted label(s), confidence, timestamp.

Day 8: Containerize & Deploy

Dockerfile, docker-compose (if needed).

Basic CI step (optional).

Total MVP: ~1–2 weeks (single dev). Faster if using prebuilt datasets and transfer learning.

Model Design Choices & Recommendations
Transfer Learning: Start with a pre-trained MobileNetV2 or EfficientNetB0 for good accuracy/latency tradeoff.

Input Size: 224×224 or 192×192 for speed.

Augmentation: RandomFlip, RandomRotation, RandomZoom, Cutout (helps generalize).

Loss & Metrics: CategoricalCrossentropy, track accuracy and top-3 accuracy; for imbalanced data use focal loss or class weights.

Quantization: For CPU inference, apply post-training quantization (TensorFlow Lite) if you need faster on-device or lower memory.

Explainability: Implement Grad-CAM to visualize which image regions the model used.

Example Endpoints (minimal)
POST /predict — multipart form: image file → returns {predictions: [{"label":"cat","score":0.93}, ...]}

GET /model/reload — admin reload model from disk (secure this)

GET /stats — returns basic usage stats from DB

Single-file MVP (offer)
I can produce a compact single-file Flask app that:

Loads a saved Keras model,

Accepts image uploads,

Runs preprocessing and returns top-k predictions,

Logs results to SQLite,

Serves a tiny HTML page for uploads.

Want me to generate that single-file Flask app now?

Extras I Can Provide (pick any)
Full training script using TensorFlow/Keras + tf.data with checkpoints.

Single-file Flask web app (upload + predict + basic UI).

Dockerfile + docker-compose for local deployment.

Grad-CAM visualization added to the web UI.

A PDF project profile (like the chatbot one) for your portfolio.

Code to convert model to TensorFlow Lite for edge deployment.
